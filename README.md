This repository provides a comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in modern C++ for use in a variety of applications. Data structures form the foundation of computer science, and are essential to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate data. This library is going to include all the commonly used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs, as well as more specialized structures like hash tables, tries, and segment trees.

Each data structure is implemented in a separate header file, with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. The code is thoroughly tested for correctness and efficiency, using a combination of hand-written tests and benchmarking against existing implementations. The library also includes detailed documentation, which explains how to use each data structure, its complexity characteristics, and any trade-offs involved.

The library is written in modern C++ and follows standard best practices for readability, maintainability, and performance. It uses features like templates, type traits, and iterators to make the code more generic and reusable. The library can be used as a reference for learning and understanding data structures, as well as a tool for developing efficient algorithms in C++.

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Whether you want to suggest improvements to existing data structures, add new ones, or fix bugs, your help is appreciated. The library is licensed under the MIT License, which allows you to use it for both open-source and commercial projects.
